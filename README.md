## Description:

Made this during my game development class for an assignment.

This is a text adventure game where you explore a "living" dungeon defeating otherworldly beasts, and avoiding deadly traps
on a journey to discover the legendary Golden Coins and defeat the Necromancer.

## Plot:

May 5th, 1394:

You are the Royal Guard for the King.

You're rushing down a long, dark path on your horse.
There's been a dramatic turn of events.
    
You recently got a letter from the King, stating that the kingdom is in need of your services.
It's been under attack by paranormal beings beyond this material world.
After many weeks, the King was informed of the location of these beings.

A large dungeon was identified as being the main home for all these ghastly beasts roaming the kingdom.
This specific dungeon is a magical dungeon, which has a life of its own.
It builds itself around any living inhabitants and summons beasts, items, traps, and locations.
The dungeon also inhabits faeries that have magical healing properties.

As sworn Royal Guard for the King, you must protect the kingdom from these beasts by slaying them in this living dungeon.

You have also heard of a mythic legend where golden coins were placed in special locations all over the dungeon.
These coins give the possessor immense boosts of strength. They also will lead you to a 'mystic figure' that rules the dungeon.
Defeat the figure, and you will be able to escape from the dungeon.
The legends also hinted at an 'apocalyptic event' that would happen afterward, but they weren't specific.

After hearing that, you took your sword, your shield, and your horse down this dark passage.

You stand before a mighty doorway. You go towards it, but you are unsure if you are ready.
